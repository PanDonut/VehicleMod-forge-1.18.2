# MrCrayfish's Vehicle Mod

MrCrayfish's Vehicle Mod is about creating fun and useful vehicles. In this mod you can find an assortment of vehicles that will help you explore, farm, transport, race, and even fly! Every vehicle can be customised with different engines and wheels to change the speed and effective surfaces the vehicles can drive on. Using a spray can you change the colour of your vehicle to any combination of dyes. The mod also includes a simple fuel production system, great for beginners to start learning about machines and fluid pipes.

* Bonus vehicles when installed with MrCrayfish's Furniture Mod
* Most importantly traffic cones you can place on the ground or wear as a hat
